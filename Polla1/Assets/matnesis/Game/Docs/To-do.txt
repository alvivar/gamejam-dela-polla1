Should eyes hide during conversations?
Reasons should hide from the window after their first fade
Animals eyes of mind

The gun ask a question: Do you want to kill someone?
The player can pick up the rifle

Make sure eyes born on all the situations

Returning to the house when she is alone
Looking at the moon

A 3D character that walks and idle?

Eye of Mind cool floating when look at him
Eye of Mind pop in introduction

Demons invitation sounds
